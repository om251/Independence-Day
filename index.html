        What is Independence Day?
      </h1>
      <p id="peo">15th August 1947 is the day embossed in the golden history of India. It is the day when India got its freedom from the 200 years of British rule. It was a hard and a long non-violent struggle in which many freedom fighters and great men sacrificed their lives for our beloved motherland.<br><br>Independence Day is like the birthday of our country. We celebrate 15th August every year as our Independence Day. It is celebrated as a national holiday throughout the country. It is called the red-letter day in the history of our country.<br><br>In 1947, on this day, India became independent. We won freedom from British power after a hard and non-violent struggle. On this day at the stroke of midnight, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our first Prime Minister, unfurled the National Flag at the Red Fort for the first time. It marked the end of the 200 years old British reign in India. We now breathe air in a free and sovereign nation. <br><br>On this special occasion, the people of India remember the selfless sacrifices and unparalleled contributions of great men and women to achieve the independence of India. Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, Sardar Patel, and Gopalbandhu Das are paid reverent homage by one and all in the country.
